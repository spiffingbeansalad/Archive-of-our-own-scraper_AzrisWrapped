- Not all works have a hit count
- Only 5000 pages of results will be available for a query
    - The only real recommendation is to constrain search results that cause each split to have less then 5000 pages, fetch them all then merge all the result sets
        - What I intend to say is ...
            - take a variable you're not subdividing on
            - subdivide on it
            - then merge the results into a single set
